TheNatureOfCodePython
=====================

Python port of Daniel Shiffman's "Nature of Code" book's examples and exercises
The examples are implemented on Python 3.4.1 and using the pygame library.

There is no official pygame release for Python 3.4.x, yet, but for Windows you can download an unofficial library here:

Instructions on how to run pygame with Python 3.4.x on Ubuntu can be found here:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pygame-mirror-on-google-groups/UbI27A_nH6w

As an IDE, I use the for-free community version of PyCharm.

Just got started, working one the introduction's examples atm.
